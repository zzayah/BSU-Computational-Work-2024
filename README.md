Role:
Laboratory Technician specializing in the Computational Analysis of "Perovskite Oxides" (characterized by ABO3). Responsibilities include utilizing advanced computational methods and software, particularly Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, to investigate the properties and behavior of perovskite materials. The role involves operating and managing simulations on the Borah and Bridges supercomputers to perform high-precision calculations.

Environment:
Working within the MATERIALab Computational Workgroup, under the guidance of Professor Oliverio Andreussi at Boise State University.
